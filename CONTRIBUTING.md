# Contributing to Color Palette Generator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Color Palette Generator! This document provides guidelines and steps for contributing.

## Documentation

The following documentation is available to help you:

1. [API Documentation](docs/API.md) - REST API endpoints and usage
2. [Database Setup](docs/database-setup.md) - MySQL setup for running tests

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glerner/gl-color-palette-generator.git
```

2. Set up Lando development environment:

```bash
# Copy the example Lando configuration
cp .lando.example.yml ~/sites/wordpress/.lando.yml

# Start Lando
cd ~/sites/wordpress && lando start

# Install WordPress and the plugin
cd ~/sites/wordpress && lando install:wordpress
```

3. Set up the test environment:

```bash
./bin/setup-plugin-tests.sh
```

This script will:
- Install composer dependencies
- Rebuild the Lando environment
- Install the WordPress test suite
- Configure the test database
- Generate wp-tests-config.php for WordPress integration tests

For detailed information about the test database setup, see [docs/database-setup.md](docs/database-setup.md).

## Testing

### Setting up the Test Environment

The test environment can be set up using different methods depending on your development environment:

#### Option 1: Using Lando (Recommended)

If you're using Lando, the setup is mostly automated:

```bash
./bin/setup-plugin-tests.sh
```

The script will detect Lando and use the default configuration from `.lando.yml`.

#### Option 2: Local Development Environment

For Local by Flywheel or other local environments, you can configure the test environment by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Set your environment variables
export WP_ROOT="/path/to/wordpress"
export DB_HOST="localhost"  # typically 'localhost' for Local by Flywheel
export DB_NAME="your_test_db"
export DB_USER="your_db_user"
export DB_PASS="your_db_password"
export WP_VERSION="latest"  # or specific version like "6.4.2"

# Run the setup script
./bin/setup-plugin-tests.sh
```

Available configuration options:

| Variable | Default (Lando) | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| WP_ROOT | /home/george/sites/wordpress | Path to WordPress installation |
| DB_HOST | database | Database hostname (use 'localhost' for Local) |
| DB_NAME | wordpress | Test database name |
| DB_USER | wordpress | Database username |
| DB_PASS | wordpress | Database password |
| WP_VERSION | latest | WordPress version to test against |
| SKIP_DB_CREATE | false | Set to 'true' to skip database creation |
| WP_TESTS_DIR | ${WP_ROOT}/wordpress-phpunit | Path to WordPress test suite |
| WP_CORE_DIR | ${WP_ROOT}/wordpress | Path to WordPress core |

### Running Tests

The plugin uses different types of tests:

1. **WP-Mock Tests** - Unit tests that mock WordPress functions:
```bash
# Using composer script
composer test:wp-mock

# Or using PHPUnit directly
lando ssh -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=tests/bootstrap.php --group wp-mock"
```

2. **Integration Tests** - Tests that require WordPress:
```bash
# Using composer script
composer test:integration

# Or using PHPUnit directly
lando ssh -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=tests/bootstrap.php --testsuite integration"
```

3. **Unit Tests** - Standard unit tests:
```bash
# Using composer script
composer test:unit

# Or using PHPUnit directly
lando ssh -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=tests/bootstrap.php --testsuite unit"
```

4. **All Tests**:
```bash
# Using composer script
composer test

# Or using PHPUnit directly
lando ssh -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=tests/bootstrap.php"
```

Note: WordPress integration tests require `wp-tests-config.php` which is generated by the setup-plugin-tests script. WP-Mock tests do not require this file.

### Test Organization

Tests are organized into three main suites:

1. **WP_Mock Tests** (`--group wp-mock`):
   - Located in `tests/providers` and `tests/api`
   - Used for testing external API interactions and isolated functionality
   - Doesn't require WordPress database or functions
   - Faster execution and more precise control

2. **WP_UnitTestCase Tests** (`--group wp-unit`):
   - Located in `tests/core`, `tests/admin`, and `tests/settings`
   - Used for testing WordPress-specific functionality
   - Requires WordPress test environment
   - Tests actual WordPress hooks, filters, and database operations

3. **Integration Tests** (`--group integration`):
   - Located in `tests/integration`
   - Tests full system integration
   - Requires complete WordPress environment

### Creating New Tests

Choose the appropriate test type based on what you're testing:

- Use **WP_Mock** when testing:
  - External API interactions
  - Complex business logic
  - Code that doesn't heavily interact with WordPress core
  - Functions that need precise control over return values

- Use **WP_UnitTestCase** when testing:
  - WordPress hooks and filters
  - Database operations
  - WordPress core function integration
  - Plugin activation/deactivation
  - WordPress admin interfaces
  - Theme integration

Example WP_Mock test:
```php
class My_Provider_Test extends \WP_Mock\Tools\TestCase {
    protected $provider;

    public function setUp(): void {
        parent::setUp();
        WP_Mock::setUp();
        $this->provider = new My_Provider(['api_key' => 'test_key']);
    }

    public function tearDown(): void {
        WP_Mock::tearDown();
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    public function test_api_call() {
        WP_Mock::userFunction('wp_remote_post')->once()->andReturn([
            'response' => ['code' => 200],
            'body' => json_encode(['success' => true])
        ]);

        $result = $this->provider->make_api_call();
        $this->assertTrue($result);
    }
}
```

Example WP_UnitTestCase test:
```php
class My_WordPress_Test extends WP_UnitTestCase {
    public function test_wordpress_integration() {
        $post_id = $this->factory->post->create();
        $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $post_id);

        $post = get_post($post_id);
        $this->assertInstanceOf('WP_Post', $post);
    }
}
```

## Sync Scripts

The plugin includes two sync scripts for different purposes:

1. `bin/sync-to-wp.sh` - Syncs the plugin files to your local WordPress test environment:
   ```bash
   ./bin/sync-to-wp.sh
   ```
   This copies all files needed for development and testing.

2. `bin/sync-to-production.sh` - Creates a clean production copy without development files:
   ```bash
   ./bin/sync-to-production.sh ~/plugin-releases/gl-color-palette-generator
   ```
   This excludes development files (tests, configs, docs) and installs only production dependencies.
