**Description**
Optimize neutral color handling by removing duplicate generation and centralizing neutral color management.

**Current Behavior**
- Neutral colors are generated in multiple places
- Duplicate neutral generation in shade-generator
- Potential inconsistency in neutral color handling

**Proposed Changes**
1. Keep neutral colors in the main palette generation
2. Remove duplicate neutral generation from shade-generator
3. Use shade-generator only for creating variations when needed

**Implementation Notes**
Files to modify:
- `/includes/color-management/class-color-palette-generator.php`
- `/includes/color-management/class-color-shade-generator.php`

Steps:
1. Identify all neutral color generation points
2. Consolidate neutral color generation in palette generator
3. Update shade generator to only create variations
4. Add clear documentation for neutral color handling
5. Update any dependent components

**Benefits**
- Reduced code duplication
- More consistent neutral colors
- Clearer responsibility separation
- Better maintainability

**Testing**
- Verify neutral colors in generated palettes
- Test shade variations of neutral colors
- Check for any regressions in existing functionality
- Validate color consistency
