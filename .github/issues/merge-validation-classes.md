**Description**
Currently, color validation is split between two classes: `Color_Validator` and `Color_Validation`. While this separation made sense during initial development, merging these classes would improve code organization and reduce potential confusion.

**Current Behavior**
- `Color_Validator`: Handles low-level color format validation and conversion
  - Validates color format syntax (hex, RGB, HSL, etc.)
  - Converts between different color formats
  - Provides utility functions for color space transformations

- `Color_Validation`: Handles high-level color and palette validation
  - Validates color combinations and relationships
  - Checks accessibility requirements (contrast ratios)
  - Validates color palette harmony and balance
  - Provides palette-wide validation rules

**Proposed Changes**
1. Create a new unified `ColorValidator` class that:
   - Uses traits or internal classes to separate concerns
   - Provides clear hierarchy of validation operations
   - Maintains backward compatibility through interface

2. Organize validation into logical groups:
   - Format validation (syntax, conversion)
   - Color properties (brightness, saturation, etc.)
   - Accessibility validation (contrast, readability)
   - Palette validation (harmony, balance)

**Implementation Notes**
Files to modify:
- `/includes/validation/class-color-validator.php`
- `/includes/validation/class-color-validation.php`

New files to create:
- `/includes/validation/traits/format-validation-trait.php`
- `/includes/validation/traits/accessibility-validation-trait.php`
- `/includes/validation/traits/palette-validation-trait.php`

Steps:
1. Create traits for different validation aspects
2. Implement new unified class
3. Add deprecation notices to old classes
4. Update all references to use new class
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Document new class structure

**Benefits**
- Clearer code organization
- Single source of truth for validation
- Easier maintenance
- Better separation of concerns through traits
- More intuitive API

**Risks and Mitigation**
- Breaking changes: Maintain old classes temporarily with deprecation notices
- Performance: Ensure trait-based approach doesn't impact performance
- Complexity: Carefully document new structure

**Additional Context**
This refactor aligns with the project's goal of maintaining clean, maintainable code while improving developer experience.
