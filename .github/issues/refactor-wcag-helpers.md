# Refactor WCAG-related Code for Better Maintainability

## Description

Several WCAG-related code patterns need refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce duplication:

1. **Duplicate WCAG Helper Functions**
   - Multiple classes have similar helper functions for checking WCAG compliance
   - Examples:
     - `meets_wcag_aa()` and `meets_wcag_aaa()` in `class-contrast-checker.php`
     - `meets_aa_large()`, `meets_aa_small()`, `meets_aaa_large()`, and `meets_aaa_small()` in `class-accessibility-checker.php`
   - Consider creating a shared trait or base class for these common WCAG compliance checks

2. **Duplicate Contrast Ratio Calculations**
   - Multiple implementations of contrast ratio calculations exist:
     - `get_contrast_ratio()` in `class-rest-controller-accessibility.php`
     - `get_contrast_ratio()` in `class-contrast-checker.php`
     - `get_contrast_ratio()` in `class-color-utility.php`
   - Related luminance calculations are also duplicated:
     - `get_relative_luminance()`
     - `get_luminance_value()`
   - Consider making `Color_Utility` the single source of truth for these calculations

3. **Similar WCAG Requirement Arrays**
   - `WCAG_REQUIREMENTS` arrays exist in multiple files:
     - `class-compliance-checker.php`
     - `class-wcag-compliance.php`
   - While these are private and don't cause conflicts, consider consolidating into a single source of truth (use includes/interfaces/interface-color-constants.php)

4. **WCAG Level Constants**
   - `WCAG_LEVEL_*` constants in `class-compliance-types.php` are separate from other WCAG-related constants
   - Consider organizing all WCAG-related constants into a more cohesive structure (use includes/interfaces/interface-color-constants.php)

## Proposed Solution

1. Create a `WCAGComplianceHelperTrait` containing:
   - Common WCAG compliance check methods
   - Unified WCAG requirements array
   - Documentation for each compliance level

2. Move all WCAG-related constants to `Color_Constants` interface or a dedicated WCAG constants interface

3. Update existing classes to use the new trait and constants

## Benefits
- Reduces code duplication
- Single source of truth for WCAG requirements
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better organized and documented WCAG compliance code

## Files to Update
- `includes/accessibility/class-contrast-checker.php`
- `includes/color-management/class-accessibility-checker.php`
- `includes/accessibility/class-compliance-checker.php`
- `includes/analysis/class-wcag-compliance.php`
- `includes/types/class-compliance-types.php`
- `includes/interfaces/interface-color-constants.php`

## Priority
Medium - No PHP Fatal Errors, but important for maintainability
