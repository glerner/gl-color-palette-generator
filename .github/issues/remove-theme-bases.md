**Description**
Remove the deprecated `theme_bases` array and associated functionality since we now have more sophisticated theme generation through AI and the `Theme_Style_Generator` class.

**Current State**
- Hardcoded `theme_bases` array exists in `class-color-scheme-generator.php`
- Used only in the `generate_theme_scheme` method
- Redundant with our current theme generation capabilities

**Files to Modify**
1. `/includes/color-management/class-color-scheme-generator.php`
   - Remove `theme_bases` array
   - Remove or refactor `generate_theme_scheme` method to use our modern theme generation

**Implementation Notes**
1. Check for any external calls to `generate_theme_scheme`
2. If method is used, update it to use `Theme_Style_Generator` instead
3. If not used, remove the method entirely
4. Update any relevant tests

**Benefits**
- Removes redundant code
- Simplifies codebase
- Eliminates potential confusion between old and new theme generation methods
- Maintains single source of truth for theme generation

**Testing**
- Verify no breaking changes
- Run test suite
- Check theme generation still works correctly

**Resolution**
âœ… Completed on 2024-12-21

Changes made:
1. Removed `theme_bases` array from `class-color-scheme-generator.php`
2. Removed unused `generate_theme_scheme` method as it was only used internally
3. Verified no external dependencies on the removed code

Impact:
- Removed ~40 lines of deprecated code
- No breaking changes
- Codebase now relies solely on modern theme generation through `Theme_Style_Generator` and AI
