## Description
The `PerformanceOptimizer` class in `includes/performance/class-performance-optimizer.php` has multiple methods that are currently missing their implementations. These methods are critical for the performance optimization of the color palette generator.

### Missing Implementations

The following private helper methods need implementation:
1. `optimize_tables()`
2. `analyze_query_patterns()`
3. `validate_optimization_settings()`
4. `get_optimization_metrics()`
5. `analyze_performance_bottlenecks()`
6. `get_next_optimization_schedule()`
7. `get_cache_statistics()`
8. `analyze_cache_efficiency()`
9. `get_performance_recommendations()`
10. `get_optimization_history()`
11. `cleanup_expired_data()`
12. `get_historical_metrics()`
13. `analyze_resource_usage()`
14. `get_optimization_logs()`
15. `analyze_optimization_impact()`
16. `get_performance_thresholds()`
17. `analyze_system_load()`
18. `get_optimization_status()`
19. `analyze_memory_usage()`
20. `get_performance_baseline()`

### Required Functionality

Each method should:
1. Implement proper performance monitoring and optimization logic
2. Include error handling and logging
3. Follow performance best practices
4. Return appropriate data structures as indicated in the method stubs

### Priority
High - These implementations are essential for:
- Optimizing database operations
- Managing cache efficiency
- Monitoring system resources
- Analyzing performance metrics
- Providing optimization recommendations

### Additional Notes
- Consider implementing unit tests for each method
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include performance benchmarking
- Document optimization strategies used
- Consider adding configuration options for different optimization levels
- Implement proper cleanup and resource management
