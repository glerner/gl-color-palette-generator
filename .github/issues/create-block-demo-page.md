**Goals**
1. Show the color palette applied to real WordPress blocks
2. Mention the Theme Variations available, and how to switch between them; mention light/dark mode
3. Display color accessibility information
4. Show color emotions and meanings
5. Provide a live example of the palette in use

**Implementation Details**

1. Create Page Template
   - [ ] Create a new page template for the demo
   - [ ] Register it properly with WordPress
