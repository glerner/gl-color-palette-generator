**Description**
Current image color extraction tests use a mock path and hardcoded expected colors, making it difficult to verify actual color extraction functionality. We should use real test images with known color compositions.

**Current State**
In `tests/color-management/test-class-color-palette-generator.php`:
```php
$image_path = '/path/to/image.jpg';
$options = ['count' => 5];
$expected_colors = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff', '#ffff00', '#ff00ff'];
```
- Uses non-existent image path
- Expected colors are arbitrary
- Test only verifies mock interaction, not actual color extraction

**Proposed Changes**
1. Add test image fixtures:
   - Create `tests/fixtures/images/` directory
   - Add test images with known color compositions:
     - `primary-colors.png`: Image with pure RGB colors
     - `grayscale.jpg`: Black and white image
     - `gradient.png`: Smooth color transition
     - `photo-nature.jpg`: Real photo with natural colors
     - `web-palette.png`: Web-safe color grid

2. Update tests:
   - Use real image fixtures
   - Document expected colors for each image
   - Test different extraction scenarios:
     - Different numbers of colors (3, 5, 8)
     - Different image types (PNG, JPG)
     - Different color compositions
     - Edge cases (monochrome, highly saturated)

3. Add test documentation:
   - Document each test image's purpose
   - Explain expected color extraction results
   - Note any specific color theory considerations

**Benefits**
- More reliable testing
- Tests actual color extraction behavior
- Provides examples for documentation
- Helps catch real-world issues

**Implementation Notes**
1. Use small, optimized images for test fixtures
2. Include both synthetic and real-world examples
3. Consider adding test cases for:
   - Image loading errors
   - Unsupported formats
   - Very large/small images
   - Images with transparency

**Testing**
- Verify color extraction accuracy
- Check performance with different image sizes
- Test error handling
- Validate results against color theory principles
