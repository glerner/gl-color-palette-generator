# Implement Color Blindness Testing
GitHub Issue: TBD
Status: Open

## Overview
Implement comprehensive color blindness simulation and validation for the color palette generator to ensure palettes are accessible to users with various types of color vision deficiency (CVD).

## Background
Currently, the plugin generates color palettes with WCAG contrast compliance but does not validate for color blindness accessibility. This feature is planned for implementation after v1.0 release.

## Requirements

### Color Blindness Simulation
- Implement simulation algorithms for:
  - Deuteranopia (reduced sensitivity to green light)
  - Protanopia (reduced sensitivity to red light)
  - Tritanopia (reduced sensitivity to blue light)
- Use established color transformation matrices for accurate simulation
- Validate simulation accuracy against known test cases

### Color Distinction Validation
- Implement methods to verify colors remain distinguishable when viewed with CVD
- Set minimum perceptual difference thresholds for CVD simulated colors
- Consider both light and dark mode variations

### Integration Points
- Update `Compliance_Checker::simulate_color_blindness()`
- Update `Compliance_Checker::validate_color_blindness_distinction()`
- Add new color blindness-specific constants to `Color_Constants`
- Add unit tests for new functionality

## Technical Considerations
- Research and implement established CVD simulation algorithms
- Consider performance impact of color transformations
- Ensure accurate color space conversions (sRGB → LMS → CVD simulation → sRGB)
- Add proper error handling for edge cases

## Resources
