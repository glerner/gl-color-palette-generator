# Code Coverage Report Errors

## Description
When generating code coverage reports during PHPUnit test execution, several interface-related errors are occurring:

1. Interface not found errors:
   - `GL_Color_Palette_Generator\Interfaces\Compliance_Checker_Interface`
   - Initially had issues with `Color_Metrics_Analyzer_Interface` (now fixed)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run PHPUnit tests with code coverage enabled
2. Observe errors in the coverage report generation phase

## Current Behavior
- Code coverage report fails to generate
- Interface-related errors prevent proper analysis of code coverage

## Expected Behavior
- Code coverage report should generate successfully
- All interfaces should be properly loaded and recognized

## Technical Details
- Error occurs during Clover XML report generation
- Issue appears to be related to autoloading of interface files
- May be related to the order of file loading in bootstrap-wp.php

## Proposed Solutions
1. Review and verify all interface file locations and namespaces
2. Ensure proper autoloading of interface files
3. Consider adding interface preloading in bootstrap-wp.php if needed
