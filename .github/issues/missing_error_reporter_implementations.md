## Description
The `ErrorReporter` class in `includes/utils/class-error-reporter.php` is missing implementations for several critical methods. These methods currently only have placeholder comments and need to be properly implemented.

### Missing Implementations

The following methods need implementation:
- `send_notification($error)`
- `filter_logs_by_timeframe($timeframe)`
- `generate_error_summary($logs)`
- `analyze_error_trends($logs)`
- `generate_error_recommendations($logs)`

### Required Functionality

Each method should:
1. `send_notification`: Implement proper error notification system (email/admin notice)
2. `filter_logs_by_timeframe`: Add logic to filter error logs by given timeframe
3. `generate_error_summary`: Create meaningful summaries of error logs
4. `analyze_error_trends`: Add trend analysis for error patterns
5. `generate_error_recommendations`: Provide actionable recommendations based on errors

### Priority
High - These are core error handling functionalities that need to be implemented for proper error tracking and reporting.

### Additional Notes
- Consider adding unit tests for each implemented method
- Ensure proper error handling within the implementations
- Add proper documentation for each method
- Consider adding logging levels and notification thresholds
