**Description**
Update the color wheel implementation to use RGB as primary colors instead of RYB for better digital color representation.

**Current Behavior**
- Uses RYB (Red, Yellow, Blue) as primary colors
- Color calculations based on traditional color wheel
- May not provide optimal results for digital displays

**Proposed Changes**
1. Update primary colors to use RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
2. Modify color calculations to work with RGB color space
3. Update color scheme generation algorithms
4. Verify all existing color schemes still work correctly

**Implementation Notes**
Files to modify:
- `/includes/color-management/class-color-wheel.php`

Steps:
1. Replace RYB primaries with RGB
2. Update color mixing calculations
3. Modify angle calculations for color schemes
4. Update complementary color logic
5. Test all color scheme types:
   - Analogous
   - Complementary
   - Split-complementary
   - Triadic
   - Tetradic
   - Monochromatic

**Benefits**
- Better color accuracy for digital displays
- More precise color calculations
- Improved color scheme generation

**Testing**
- Generate all types of color schemes
- Compare results with current implementation
- Verify color harmony
- Check edge cases
