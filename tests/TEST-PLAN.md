## Mocking Approaches in Unit Tests

The project uses several mocking approaches for unit tests, all of which are valid for isolating the code under test from its dependencies:

### No Mocks
- Used for testing simple classes with minimal dependencies
- Direct instantiation of the class under test
- Appropriate for pure utility functions or classes with no external dependencies
- Example: `test-color-utility.php`

### Mockery
- Third-party PHP mocking framework with expressive API
- Used for complex mocking scenarios
- Requires explicit setup and teardown with `Mockery::close()`
- Example: `test-class-color-metrics.php`

### PHPUnit's createMock
- Built into PHPUnit
- Simpler syntax for basic mocking needs
- Good for straightforward dependency mocking
- Example: `test-class-palette-cache.php`

### WP_Mock
- Specialized for mocking WordPress functions and hooks
- Used in wp-mock tests to simulate WordPress environment
- Requires special setup in bootstrap files

The choice between these approaches doesn't affect test classification (unit, wp-mock, integration) but is based on the complexity of the mocking needs and developer preference.

## Test Environment Requirements

### WordPress Test Environment
- WordPress >= 6.2
- PHP >= 8.0
- MySQL/MariaDB

### Provider API Access
- OpenAI API key
- Azure OpenAI credentials
- Anthropic API key
- PaLM API key
- Cohere API key
- HuggingFace API token

### File System Access
- Write permissions for cache directory
- Write permissions for export directory
- Temporary directory access

## Continuous Integration
- PHPUnit configuration
- Code coverage reports
- WordPress Coding Standards checks
- Performance benchmarks
