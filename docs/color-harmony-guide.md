# Understanding Color Harmonies

Color harmonies are combinations of colors that work well together based on their positions on the color wheel. Understanding these relationships helps create visually appealing and balanced designs.

## Common Color Harmonies

### Analogous
Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. Creates a harmonious, comfortable design.
- Example: Yellow, Yellow-Green, Green
- Best for: Creating a cohesive, unified look
- Use when: You want a gentle, soothing design

### Complementary
Colors opposite each other on the color wheel. Creates high contrast and visual impact.
- Example: Blue and Orange
- Best for: Making elements stand out
- Use when: You need strong emphasis or call-to-action elements

### Analogous with Complement
A base color, its analogous colors, and its complement. Perfect for WordPress themes needing both harmony and contrast.
- Example: Blue (base), Blue-Purple and Blue-Green (analogous), Orange (complement)
- Best for: WordPress themes needing primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Use when: You want both harmony and contrast
- Theme Usage:
  - Primary: Base color
  - Secondary: one of the Analogous colors
  - Accent: Complement color

### Triadic
Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel. Creates vibrant, balanced designs.
- Example: Red, Yellow, Blue

Different shades and tints of the same color. Creates a cohesive, sophisticated look.
- Example: Light Blue, Blue, Dark Blue

### Split-Complementary
A base color and two colors adjacent to its complement. Provides high contrast while being easier to balance than complementary colors.
- Example: Blue with Yellow-Orange and Red-Orange
- Best for: Beginners wanting high contrast
- Use when: Complementary feels too intense

### Tetradic (Double Complementary)
Two pairs of complementary colors. Creates a rich, dynamic color scheme best used with one dominant color.
- Example: Blue and Orange with Yellow and Purple

Four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel. Creates a balanced, vibrant design when used with varying intensities.
- Example: Red, Yellow-Green, Blue, and Purple-Red
- Best for: Rich, varied designs
- Use when: You need multiple colors with equal emphasis
