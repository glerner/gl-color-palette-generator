# Code Inventory

This directory contains the inventory of code components for the GL Color Palette Generator plugin rewrite.

## Functional Groups

3. [Palette Management](./palette-management/)
4. [AI Generation](./ai-generation/)
5. [WordPress Integration](./wordpress-integration/)
6. [External Providers](./external-providers/)
7. [Output Formats](./output-formats/)

## Structure

Each functional group directory contains:

- `classes.md` - Inventory of classes in the group
- `methods.md` - Inventory of methods in the group
- `constants.md` - Inventory of constants in the group

## Usage

These inventory files serve as documentation and planning tools during the rewrite process. They help track what has been implemented and what remains to be done.
