# Code Analysis Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the analysis of the existing codebase, as outlined in Step 3 of the PROJECT-ROADMAP.md.

## Purpose

These documents capture detailed findings from the code analysis process, including:

1. Valuable components worth preserving
2. External libraries in use
3. Reusable algorithms and patterns
4. Well-structured constants and definitions
5. Test-to-feature mappings

## Documents

- [valuable-components.md](./valuable-components.md) - Components identified for preservation
- [external-libraries.md](./external-libraries.md) - Third-party libraries worth keeping
- [test-to-feature-mapping.md](./test-to-feature-mapping.md) - Mapping between tests and features
- [reusable-patterns.md](./reusable-patterns.md) - Algorithms and patterns worth preserving
- [constants-definitions.md](./constants-definitions.md) - Well-structured constants to keep

## Relationship to Roadmap

This documentation supports Step 3 of the project roadmap: "Extract Specifications from Tests" by providing detailed analysis that would otherwise clutter the main roadmap document.
