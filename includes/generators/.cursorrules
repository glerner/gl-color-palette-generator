## To align with WordPress coding standards for a plugin, especially for version 6.7, we should follow the guidelines for naming conventions, which typically include:
1. File Names: Use lowercase letters with hyphens to separate words.
2. Class Names: Use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase).
3. Function Names: Use snake_case (lowercase letters with underscores).

## Rules for Markown .md edits
- When proposing an edit to a markdown file, first decide if there will be code snippets in the markdown file.
- If there are no code snippets, wrap the beginning and end of your answer in backticks, and specify markdown as the language.
- If there are code snippets, wrap the beginning and end of your answers inside 5 backticks. output the markdown content as free text. You may use backticks for code snippets within the markdown content.

Please consult the @Codebase for overall details and locate the information or file you need. You may be able to access them directly.
Refer to the @project_structure.txt file for a structured view of the projectâ€™s relevant files (.ts, .js, .json, .md, .ps1) and directories. Note that standard development folders (node_modules, .git, .vscode), hidden files, and package-lock.json are excluded from this view.
