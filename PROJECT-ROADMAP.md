# GL Color Palette Generator Project Roadmap

This document outlines the revised approach for the GL Color Palette Generator plugin. After assessment, we've determined that completing the test organization work and then rebuilding the plugin from scratch will be more efficient than trying to fix the existing implementation.

## Phase 1: Complete Current Test Organization

### ‚úÖ Finish Test Organization (In Progress)
- Complete processing of `test_analysis_results.txt`
- Finalize organizing tests by type (unit, wp-mock, integration)
- Ensure all tests are in appropriate directories with correct namespaces
- Validate that the testing structure is fully functional

### ‚úÖ Apply Interface Fixes
- Run `bin/interface-test-fixer.sh` to identify interface issues
- Fix interface implementations in test files
- Update interface references for consistency
- Document completed fixes

## Phase 2: Extract Reusable Testing Framework

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Separate Testing Framework Repository
- Extract the PHPUnit testing structure to a standalone repository
- Include directory structure for different test types
- Include base test classes and bootstrap files
- Document the testing approach and organization
- Create examples for each test type

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Document Testing Framework
- Create comprehensive documentation for the testing framework
- Include setup instructions for new projects
- Document test types and when to use each
- Provide examples of mocking strategies

## Phase 3: Prepare for Rebuild

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Specifications from Tests
- Review test files to understand expected functionality
- Create a test-to-feature mapping document
- Identify core vs. peripheral functionality
- Extract business rules and requirements from tests
- Document API integrations and their expected behaviors

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Preserve Valuable Documentation
- Identify which documentation is still relevant
- Update architectural and design documentation
- Create a documentation plan for the new implementation
- Archive the original project for reference

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up New Project Structure
- Rename current folder to `~/sites/gl-gpg-v0`
- Create new `~/sites/gl-color-palette-generator` directory
- Import testing framework to new repository
- Set up proper WordPress plugin structure
- Configure development environment (separate from plugin development folder)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Development Tools
- Set up Composer with appropriate dependencies
- Configure PHPStan for static analysis
- Set up PHPCS with WordPress coding standards
- Set up Git for the new repository
- Set up JavaScript testing framework (Jest, etc.)
- Create build process for JS assets (webpack, etc.)
- Document the development environment setup
- Create CI/CD configuration if applicable
- Migrate relevant configuration from original project

## Phase 4: Rebuild Implementation

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Core Functionality
- Start with essential color manipulation classes
- Follow WordPress coding standards from the beginning
- Use proper namespaces and class organization
- Write tests for each component as you build

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Provider Integrations
- Build API integrations with proper abstraction
- Ensure consistent interface implementation
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Test each provider thoroughly

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Develop WordPress Integration
- Implement admin pages and settings
- Add shortcodes and block editor integration
- Set up proper hooks and filters
- Ensure proper asset management

### üîü Develop JavaScript Components
- Implement front-end functionality with modern JS practices
- Ensure proper integration with WordPress enqueuing
- Test JavaScript functionality across browsers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Finalize and Document
- Complete user documentation
- Finalize developer documentation
- Create deployment and update procedures
- Prepare for release

## Methodical Approach

Throughout all phases, we'll maintain the same methodical approach used for test organization and interface fixes:

1. **Analyze**: Create scripts to analyze the current state when needed
2. **Document**: Generate results files documenting issues or requirements
3. **Plan**: Create detailed plans for addressing each component
4. **Batch Process**: Work in manageable batches with clear boundaries
5. **Track**: Document progress and changes systematically
6. **Validate**: Test each component thoroughly as it's developed

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clean Architecture**: Start with proper WordPress coding standards
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component as it's built
3. **Clear Documentation**: Document as we go rather than retrofitting
4. **Reusable Components**: Create modular, reusable code
5. **Maintainable Codebase**: Easier to maintain and extend
6. **Valuable Testing Framework**: Create a reusable testing structure for future projects

This revised approach preserves the valuable work done on test organization while providing a clear path to a properly implemented plugin.
